# Transit-System
Program which manages the transit system in a particular city for bus and subway. 

-The UI for the project is divided into 2 screens, the Manager and the User.
-The manager decides when to start the transit system and can check the statistics, log and other information offline.
-When the system is running, the user can select whether they are travelling by Bus or Subway.
-A 2 hour transfer is added when the initial tap is made and works on either of the transit.
